# Challenges: 
- Finding needed Bootstrap components as I was new to this framework was my primary challenge. 
- Working with the Bootstrap grid system was challenging for me, but I learned a lot by trial and error. 
- Animating the banner sections of the **Homepage** was one of the challenges as I wanted to stay minimal but still interactive. I wanted each banner to have a fade-in and out animation by scroll. 
I used this tutorial to achieve this purpose [Animate On Scroll Webpage | AOS Library] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptfUwPJbGlQ)
- I wanted to use pop-ups/modals for showcasing my projects by clicking on each workâ€™s designated button. For this purpose, I used the modal component from Bootstrap, but my modals were not working. By searching for the reason and trying many possible solutions, I finally solved this problem by simply including the JavaScript code inside my main code and the bootstrap bundle file inside my folder.
- One of the most challenging yet fun parts was **animating the logo** ðŸ˜Š
 This been said, I looked into many articles for SVG line animation to figure out the easiest and fastest way, and I finally decided to use Chris Coyierâ€™s tutorial on how to animate an SVG shape.  I followed this tutorial step by step and animated my logo. The result might not look perfect, but it worthed the try.
